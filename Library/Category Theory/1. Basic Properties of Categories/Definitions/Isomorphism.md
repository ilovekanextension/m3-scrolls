**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. A morphism $f:a\to b$ in $\mathsf{C}$ is called an **isomorphism** if there is a morphism $g:b\to a$ in $\mathsf{C}$ such that $$g\circ f=\text{id}_{a}$$and $$f\circ g=\text{id}_{b}.$$
If $f:a\to b$ is an isomorphism, we say that $a$ is **isomorphic** to $b$ and write $$a\cong b.$$
By [[Uniqueness of Inverses of Isomorphisms]], the morphism $g$ above, if it exists, is unique. We call it the **inverse** of $f$ and denote it as $f^{-1}$.

Isomorphisms are also called **invertible** morphisms.
