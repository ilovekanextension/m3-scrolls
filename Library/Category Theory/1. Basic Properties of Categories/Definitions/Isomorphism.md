**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. A morphism $f:A\to B$ in $\mathsf{C}$ is called an **isomorphism** if there is a morphism $g:B\to A$ in $\mathsf{C}$ such that $$g\circ f=\text{id}_{A}$$and $$f\circ g=\text{id}_{B}.$$
If $f:A\to B$ is an isomorphism, we say that $A$ is **isomorphic** to $B$ and write $$A\cong B.$$
By [[Uniqueness of Inverses of Isomorphisms]], the morphism $g$ above, if it exists, is unique. We call it the **inverse** of $f$ and denote it as $f^{-1}$.

Isomorphisms are also called **invertible** morphisms.
