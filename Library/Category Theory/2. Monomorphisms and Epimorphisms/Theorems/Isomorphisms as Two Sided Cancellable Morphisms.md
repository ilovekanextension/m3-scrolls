**Theorem.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. Suppose $f:A\to B$ is an isomorphism in $\mathsf{C}$. Then, $f$ is a monomorphism and an epimorphism.

**Proof.** By [[Isomorphisms as Two Sided Invertible Morphisms]], $f$ is a split monomorphism and a split epimorphism. By [[Split Monomorphisms as Monomorphisms]] and [[Split Epimorphisms as Epimorphisms]], this means $f$ is a monomorphism and an epimorphism. $\blacksquare$
