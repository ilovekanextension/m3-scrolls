**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. A morphism $f:a\to b$ in $\mathsf{C}$ is called a **split epimorphism** if $f^\text{op}$ is a split monomorphism in $\mathsf{C}^\text{op}$. That is, there is a morphism $g:b\to a$ such that $$f\circ g=\text{id}_{b}.$$
Split epimorphisms are also called **right-invertible** morphisms.
