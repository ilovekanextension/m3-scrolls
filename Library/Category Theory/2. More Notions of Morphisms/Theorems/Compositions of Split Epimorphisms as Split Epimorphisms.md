**Theorem.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. Let $f:a\to b$ and $g:b\to c$ be split epimorphisms in $\mathsf{C}$. Then, $g\circ f:a\to c$ is also a split epimorphism.

**Proof.** This follows by applying [[Principle of Duality]] on [[Compositions of Split Monomorphisms as Split Monomorphisms]]. $\blacksquare$
