**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ and $\mathsf{D}$ be categories. Let $X$ be an object in $\mathsf{C}$. By [[Constant Functors as Functors]], the map from $\mathsf{C}$ to $\mathsf{D}$ that assigns
- to each object $A$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the object $X$ and
- to each morphism $f:A\to B$ the morphism $\text{id}_{X}:X\to X$

is a functor. We call it as the **constant functor** on $X$ and denote it as $\Delta_{X}:\mathsf{C}\to \mathsf{D}$.
