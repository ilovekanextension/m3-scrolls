**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ and $\mathsf{D}$ be categories. Let $x$ be an object in $\mathsf{C}$. By [[Constant Functors as Functors]], the map from $\mathsf{C}$ to $\mathsf{D}$ that assigns
- to each object $a$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the object $x$ and
- to each morphism $f:a\to b$ the morphism $\text{id}_{x}:x\to x$

is a functor. We call it as the **constant functor** on $x$ and denote it (by abuse of language) as $x:\mathsf{C}\to \mathsf{D}$.
