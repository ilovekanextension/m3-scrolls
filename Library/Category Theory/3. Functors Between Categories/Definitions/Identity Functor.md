**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. By [[Identity Maps as Functors]], the map $I$ that assigns
- to each object $A$ in $\mathsf{C}$ itself (so $I(A)=A$) and
- to each morphism $f:A\to B$ in $\mathsf{C}$ itself (so $I(f)=f$)

is a functor. We call this functor as the **identity functor** of $\mathsf{C}$ and denote it as $\text{id}_{\mathsf{C}}$.
