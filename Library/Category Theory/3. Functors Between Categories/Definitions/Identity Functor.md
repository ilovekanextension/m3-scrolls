**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. By [[Identity Maps as Functors]], the map $I$ that assigns
- to each object $a$ in $\mathsf{C}$ itself (so $I(a)=a$) and
- to each morphism $f:a\to b$ in $\mathsf{C}$ itself (so $I(f)=f$)

is a functor. We call this functor as the **identity functor** of $\mathsf{C}$ and denote it as $\text{id}_{\mathsf{C}}$.
