**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ and $\mathsf{D}$ be categories. Let $F:\mathsf{C}\to \mathsf{D}$. By [[Maps Into Identity Morphisms as Natural Transformations]], the transformation $\iota$ from $F$ to $F$ defined as $$\iota_{A}=\text{id}_{F(A)}$$is a natural transformation. We call this natural transformation as the **identity natural transformation** of $F$ and denote it as $\text{id}_{F}$.
