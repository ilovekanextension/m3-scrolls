**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a locally small category. Suppose $X$ is an object in $\mathsf{C}$. By [[Hom-Functors as Functors]], the map that assigns
- to each object $A$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the set $\mathsf{C}(X,A)$ and
- to each morphism $f:A\to B$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the post-composition function $f\circ -:\mathsf{C}(X,A)\to \mathsf{C}(X,B)$

is a functor from $\mathsf{C}$ to $\mathsf{Set}$, and the map that assigns
- to each object $A$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the set $\mathsf{C}(A,X)$ and
- to each morphism $f:A\to B$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the pre-composition function $-\circ f:\mathsf{C}(B,X)\to \mathsf{C}(A,X)$

is a functor from $\mathsf{C}^\text{op}$ to $\mathsf{Set}$. The former and the latter are denoted as $h^X$ and $h_{X}$ respectively. Functors taking either of these forms are called **hom-functors**.
