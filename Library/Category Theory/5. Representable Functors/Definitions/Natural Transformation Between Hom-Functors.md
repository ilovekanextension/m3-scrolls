**Theorem.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a locally small category. Let $f:x\to y$ be a morphism in $\mathsf{C}$. By [[Maps Into Pre- and Post-Composition Functions as Natural Transformations]], the map that assigns to each object $a$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the pre-composition function $$-\circ f:\mathsf{C}(y,a)\to \mathsf{C}(x,a)$$is a natural transformation from $h^y$ to $h^x$. Likewise, the map that assigns to each object $a$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the post-composition function $$f\circ -:\mathsf{C}(a,x)\to \mathsf{C}(a,y)$$is a natural transformation from $h_{x}$ to $h_{y}$. The former and the latter are denoted as $h^f$ and $h_{f}$ respectively.
