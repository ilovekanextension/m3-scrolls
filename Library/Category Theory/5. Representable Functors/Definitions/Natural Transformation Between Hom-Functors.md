**Theorem.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a locally small category. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism in $\mathsf{C}$. By [[Maps Into Pre- and Post-Composition Functions as Natural Transformations]], the transformation $\nu$ from $h^Y$ to $h^X$ defined as $$\nu_{A}=-\circ f:\mathsf{C}(Y,A)\to \mathsf{C}(X,A)$$and the transformation $\sigma$ from $h_{X}$ to $h_{Y}$ defined as $$\sigma_{A}=f\circ -:\mathsf{C}(A,X)\to \mathsf{C}(A,Y)$$are both natural transformations. The former and the latter are denoted as $h^f$ and $h_{f}$ respectively.
