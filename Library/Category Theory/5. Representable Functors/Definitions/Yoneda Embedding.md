**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a locally small category. By [[Yoneda Embeddings as Functors]], the map that assigns
- to each object $X$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the functor $h^X$ and
- to each morphism $f:X\to Y$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the natural transformation $h^f:h^Y\Rightarrow h^X$

is a functor from $\mathsf{C}^\text{op}$ to $\mathsf{Set}^\mathsf{C}$. Likewise, the map that assigns
- to each object $X$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the functor $h_{X}$ and
- to each morphism $f:X\to Y$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the natural transformation $h_{f}:h_{X}\Rightarrow h_{Y}$

is a functor from $\mathsf{C}$ to $\mathsf{Set}^{\mathsf{C}^\text{op}}$. The former and the latter are denoted as $h^\bullet$ and $h_{\bullet}$ respectively. These functors are called **Yoneda embeddings**.
