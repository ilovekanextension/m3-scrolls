**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a locally small category. By [[Yoneda Embeddings as Functors]], the map $H$ that assigns
- to each object $x$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the functor $h^x$ and
- to each morphism $f:x\to y$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the natural transformation $h^f:h^y\Rightarrow h^x$

is a functor from $\mathsf{C}^\text{op}$ to $\mathsf{Set}^\mathsf{C}$. Likewise, the map $H$ that assigns
- to each object $x$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the functor $h_{x}$ and
- to each morphism $f:x\to y$ in $\mathsf{C}$ the natural transformation $h_{f}:h_{x}\Rightarrow h_{y}$

is a functor from $\mathsf{C}$ to $\mathsf{Set}^{\mathsf{C}^\text{op}}$. The former and the latter are denoted as $h^\bullet$ and $h_{\bullet}$ respectively. These functors are called **Yoneda embeddings**.
