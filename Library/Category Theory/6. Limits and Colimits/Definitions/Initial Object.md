**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. The colimit of the empty functor $\mathsf{0}\to \mathsf{C}$ is called the **initial object** of $\mathsf{C}$. It is denoted as $0_{\mathsf{C}}$ (or simply $0$ if $\mathsf{C}$ is known from context).

Explicitly, the colimit property of $0$ states that for all objects $A$ in $\mathsf{C}$ there is a unique morphism $f:0\to A$.
