**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. The limit of the empty functor $\mathsf{0}\to \mathsf{C}$ is called the **terminal object** of $\mathsf{C}$. It is denoted as $1_{\mathsf{C}}$ (or simply $1$ if $\mathsf{C}$ is known from context).

Explicitly, the limit property of $1$ states that for all objects $A$ in $\mathsf{C}$ there is a unique morphism $f:A\to 1$.
