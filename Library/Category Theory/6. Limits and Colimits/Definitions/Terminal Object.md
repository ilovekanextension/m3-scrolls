**Definition.** Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. An object $t$ in $\mathsf{C}$ is said to be **terminal** if for all objects $a$ in $\mathsf{C}$ there is a unique morphism $f:a\to t$.

By [[Uniqueness of Terminal Objects]], a terminal object in $\mathsf{C}$, if it exists, is unique up to isomorphism. Therefore, we can speak of **the** terminal object of a category. The terminal object of $\mathsf{C}$ is denoted as $1_{\mathsf{C}}$ (or simply $1$ if the context is known).
