**Definition.** Let $A$ be a set. A family $F$ of subsets of $A$ is called a **partition** of $A$ if any (and therefore, by [[Equivalence of Definitions of Partitions]], all) of the following statements are true.
1. The following properties are satisfied.
	- For all $X\in F$, $X$ is nonempty.
	- $\bigcup F=A$.
	- For all $X,Y\in F$, if $X\cap Y$ is nonempty, then $X=Y$.
2. The following properties are satisfied.
	- For all $X\in F$, $X$ is nonempty.
	- For all $a\in A$, there is a unique $X\in F$ such that $a\in X$.
