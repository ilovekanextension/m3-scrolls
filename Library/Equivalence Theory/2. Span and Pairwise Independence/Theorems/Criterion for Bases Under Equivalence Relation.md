**Theorem.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $A$. Suppose $B\subseteq A$. Then, $B$ is a basis for $A$ if and only if the function $f:B\to A/{\sim}$ defined as $$f(b)=[b]_{\sim}$$is bijective.

**Proof.** By definition, $B$ is a basis for $A$ if and only if $B$ spans $A$ and is pairwise independent. By [[Criterion for Spanning Sets]] and [[Criterion for Pairwise Independent Sets]], $B$ is then a basis if and only if $f$ is injective and surjective, so $B$ is a basis if and only if $f$ is bijective. $\blacksquare$
