**Theorem.** Let $G$ be a group. Suppose $a\in G$.
1. Suppose that for all $x\in G$, $a\circ x=x$. Then, $a=1$.
2. Suppose that for all $x\in G$, $x\circ a=x$. Then, $a=1$.

**Proof of First Statement.** We have $$a\circ 1=1=1\circ 1,$$so by [[Cancellation Properties on Groups]] $a=1$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of Second Statement.** We have $$1\circ a=1=1\circ 1,$$so by [[Cancellation Properties on Groups]] $a=1$. $\blacksquare$
