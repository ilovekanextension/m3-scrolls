**Theorem.** Let $G$ be a group. Suppose $a,b\in G$.
1. Suppose that $a\circ b=1$. Then, $b=a^{-1}$.
2. Suppose that $b\circ a=1$. Then, $b=a^{-1}$.

**Proof of First Statement.** We have $$a\circ b=1=a\circ a^{-1},$$so by [[Cancellation Properties on Groups]] $b=a^{-1}$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of Second Statement.** We have $$b\circ a=1=a^{-1}\circ a,$$so by [[Cancellation Properties on Groups]] $b=a^{-1}$. $\blacksquare$
