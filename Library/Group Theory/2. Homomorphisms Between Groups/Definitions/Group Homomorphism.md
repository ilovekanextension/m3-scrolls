**Theorem.** Let $G=(G,\circ)$ and $H=(H,+)$ be groups. A function $\phi:G\to H$ is called a **group homomorphism** if the following properties are satisfied.
1. **Preservation of Identities.** We have $$\phi(1_{G})=1_{H}.$$
2. **Preservation of Compositions.** For all $a,b\in G$, $$\phi(a\circ b)=\phi(a)+\phi(b).$$
3. **Preservation of Inverses.** For all $a\in G$, $$\phi(a^{-1})=\phi(a)^{-1}.$$

By [[Preservation of Group Identities Under Group Homomorphisms]] and [[Preservation of Group Inverses Under Group Homomorphisms]], it is enough for a function $\phi$ to preserve compositions in order to be a group homomorphism.
