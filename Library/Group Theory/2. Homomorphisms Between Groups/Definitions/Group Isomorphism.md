**Theorem.** Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. A group homomorphism $\phi:G\to H$ is said to be a **group isomorphism** if it satisfies any (and therefore, by [[Group Isomorphisms as Bijective Group Homomorphisms]], all) of the following properties.
1. There is a group homomorphism $\eta:H\to G$ such that $\eta\circ\phi=\text{id}_{G}$ and $\phi\circ\eta=\text{id}_{H}$.
2. $\phi$ is bijective.

Therefore, a group isomorphism is an isomorphism in $\mathsf{Grp}$.
If $\phi:G\to H$ is a group isomorphism, we say that $G$ is **isomorphic** to $H$ and write $$G\cong H.$$
