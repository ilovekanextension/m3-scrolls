**Definition.** Let $G$ be a group. Let $A$ be a set. A **group action** of $G$ on $A$ is a function $\rho:G\times A\to A$ satisfying the following properties.
- For all $a\in A$, $$\rho(1,a)=a.$$
- For all $g,h\in G$ and $a\in A$, $$\rho(g\circ h,a)=\rho(g,\rho(h,a)).$$

If $\rho$ is a group action of $G$ on $A$, we say that $G$ **acts** on $A$ (by $\rho$).
