**Theorem.** Let $A$ be a set. Then, the set of all bijective functions on $A$ together with the identity function $\text{id}_{A}$, function composition $\circ$, and function inverses $(-)^{-1}$ is a group.

**Proof.**
- **Associativity.** This holds by [[Associativity of Relation Composition]].
- **Existence of Identity.** This holds by [[Compositions with Identity Functions]].
- **Existence of Inverses.** This holds by [[Compositions of Bijective Functions with Their Inverses as Identity Functions]]. $\blacksquare$
