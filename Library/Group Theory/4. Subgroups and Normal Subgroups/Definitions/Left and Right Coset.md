**Definition.** Let $G$ be a group. Let $S$ be a subgroup of $G$. For all $a\in G$, the set $$a\circ S=\{a\circ s\in G\mid s\in S\}$$is called the **left coset** of $S$ in $G$ determined by $a$. Likewise, for all $a\in G$, the set $$S\circ a=\{s\circ a\in G\mid s\in S\}$$is called the **right coset** of $S$ in $G$ determined by $a$. The set of all left cosets and right cosets of $S$ is denoted as $G/S$ and $S\backslash G$ respectively.
