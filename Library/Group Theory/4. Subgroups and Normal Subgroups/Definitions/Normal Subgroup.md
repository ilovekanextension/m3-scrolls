**Definition.** Let $G$ be a group. Let $N$ be a subgroup of $G$. We say that $N$ is **normal** (in $G$) if any (and therefore, by [[Equivalence of Definitions of Normal Subgroups]], all) of the following properties are satisfied.
1. For all $a\in G$ and $n\in N$, $a\circ n\circ a^{-1}\in N$.
2. For all $a\in G$, $a\circ N=N\circ a$.
