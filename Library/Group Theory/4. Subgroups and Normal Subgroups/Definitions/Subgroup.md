**Definition.** Let $G$ be a group. A subset $S$ of $G$ is said to be a **subgroup** of $G$ if the following properties are satisfied.
- **Closure Under Identity.** $1\in S$.
- **Closure Under Composition.** For all $a,b\in S$, $a\circ b\in S$.
- **Closure Under Inverses.** For all $a\in S$, $a^{-1}\in S$.

If $S$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $S$ together with $1_{G}$, the restricted operation $\circ$, and the restricted function $(-)^{-1}$ can be regarded as a group (hence the name).
