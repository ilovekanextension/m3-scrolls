**Theorem.** Let $G$ be a group.
1. $\{1\}$ is a subgroup of $G$.
2. $G$ is a subgroup of $G$.

**Proof of First Statement.** By definition, $1\in\{1\}$. Also, $1\circ 1=1$ and, by [[Inverses of Group Identities]], $1^{-1}=1$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of Second Statement.** This is clear. $\blacksquare$
