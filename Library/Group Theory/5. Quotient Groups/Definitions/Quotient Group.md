**Definition.** Let $G$ be a group. Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. By [[Group Structure on Set of Left Cosets of Normal Subgroups]], the set $G/N$ together with
- the set $N$,
- the operation $*:G/N\times G/N\to G/N$ defined as $$(a\circ N)*(b\circ N)=(a\circ b)\circ N,$$and
- the function $(-)^{-1}:G/N\to G/N$ defined as $$(a\circ N)^{-1}=a^{-1}\circ N$$

is a group. We call this group as the **quotient group** of $G$ by $N$.
