**Definition.** Let $M=(M,\circ)$, $N=(N,+)$, and $P=(P,*)$ be monoids. Let $\phi:M\to N$ and $\eta:N\to P$ be monoid homomorphisms. By [[Compositions of Monoid Homomorphisms as Monoid Homomorphisms]], $\eta\circ \phi$ is also a monoid homomorphism. We call it as the **composition** of $\phi$ and $\eta$.
