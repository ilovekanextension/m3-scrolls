**Definition.** Let $M=(M,\circ)$ and $N=(N,+)$ be monoids. A monoid homomorphism $\phi:M\to N$ is said to be a **monoid isomorphism** if it satisfies any (and therefore, by [[Monoid Isomorphisms as Bijective Monoid Homomorphisms]], all) of the following properties.
1. There is a monoid homomorphism $\eta:N\to M$ such that $\eta\circ\phi=\text{id}_{M}$ and $\phi\circ\eta=\text{id}_{N}$.
2. $\phi$ is bijective.

Therefore, a monoid isomorphism is an isomorphism in $\mathsf{Mon}$.
If $\phi:M\to N$ is a monoid isomorphism, we say that $M$ is **isomorphic** to $N$ and write $$M\cong N.$$
