**Definition.** Let $M$ be a monoid. A subset $S$ of $M$ is said to be a **submonoid** of $M$ if the following properties are satisfied.
- **Closure Under Identity.** $1\in S$.
- **Closure Under Composition.** For all $a,b\in S$, $a\circ b\in S$.

If $S$ is a submonoid of $M$, then $S$ together with $1_{M}$ and the restricted operation $\circ$ can be regarded as a monoid (hence the name).
