**Theorem.** Let $M$ be a monoid. Suppose $a\in M$.
1. Suppose that for all $x\in M$, $a\circ x=x$. Then, $a=1$.
2. Suppose that for all $x\in M$, $x\circ a=x$. Then, $a=1$.

**Proof of First Statement.** Since $1\in M$, in particular $a\circ 1=1$. However, we also have $a\circ 1=a$. Therefore, $a=1$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of Second Statement.** Since $1\in M$, in particular $1\circ a=1$. However, we also have $1\circ a=a$. Therefore, $a=1$. $\blacksquare$
