**Definition.** The set $\mathbb{Z}$ of **integers**, which is the set of numbers $$\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots$$is taken to be a nontrivial commutative ring with usual addition and multiplication.

The following notations are frequently used.
- The set of all **positive integers**, which are the numbers $$1,2,3,\dots$$is denoted as $\mathbb{Z}^+$. An integer $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ is said to be **positive**.
- The set of all **nonnegative integers**, which are the numbers $$0,1,2,3,\dots$$is denoted as $\mathbb{N}$. An integer $n\in \mathbb{N}$ is said to be **nonnegative** and is usually called a **natural** number.
