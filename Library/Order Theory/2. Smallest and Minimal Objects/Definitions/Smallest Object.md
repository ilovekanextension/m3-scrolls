**Definition.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $\leq$ be a partial order on $A$. Suppose $B\subseteq A$. An object $b\in B$ is called a **smallest object** of $B$ (**under** $\leq$) if for all $x\in B$ we have $b\leq x$.

By [[Uniqueness of Smallest Objects]], a smallest object of $B$, when it exists, must be unique. If $b$ is a smallest object of $B$, we can therefore call it as **the** smallest object of $B$.
