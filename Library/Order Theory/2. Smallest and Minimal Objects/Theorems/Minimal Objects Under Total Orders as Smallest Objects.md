**Theorem.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $\leq$ be a total order on $A$. Suppose $B\subseteq A$. Suppose $b$ is a minimal object of $B$. Then, $b$ is also the smallest object of $B$.

**Proof.** Suppose $x\in B$. Since $\leq$ is a total order, we have $x\leq b$ or $b\leq x$. We proceed by cases; in each case we will show that $b\leq x$.
- **Case** $x\leq b$. Since $b$ is minimal, we must have $x=b$. By reflexivity, $b\leq b$, so $b\leq x$.
- **Case** $b\leq x$. This is precisely what we want to show. $\blacksquare$
