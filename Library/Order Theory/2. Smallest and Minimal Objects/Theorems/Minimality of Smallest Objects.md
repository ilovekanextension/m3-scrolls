**Theorem.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $\leq$ be a partial order on $A$. Suppose $B\subseteq A$. Suppose $b$ is the smallest object of $B$.
1. $b$ is a minimal object of $B$.
2. Suppose $c$ is a minimal object of $B$. Then, $b=c$.

**Proof of First Statement.** Suppose $x\in B$, and suppose that $x\leq b$. Since $b$ is the smallest object of $B$, we have $b\leq x$. By antisymmetry, we therefore have $x=b$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of Second Statement.** Since $b$ is the smallest object of $B$ and $c\in B$, we have $b\leq c$. Since $c$ is minimal and $b\leq c$, we have $b=c$. $\blacksquare$
