**Theorem.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $\leq$ be a partial order on $A$. Then, $$(\leq^{\text{op}})^\text{op}={\leq}.$$
**Proof.** By definition, $(\leq^{\text{op}})^\text{op}$ is equal to $(\leq^{-1})^{-1}$, so by [[Involution Property on Relation Inverses]] $(\leq^\text{op})^{\text{op}}$ is equal to $\leq$. $\blacksquare$
