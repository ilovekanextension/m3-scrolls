**Theorem.**  Let $A$ be a set. Let $\leq$ be a total order on $A$. Suppose $B\subseteq A$. Suppose $b$ is a maximal object of $B$ under $\leq$. Then, $b$ is also the greatest object of $B$ under $\leq$.

**Proof.** By [[Duality of Minimal and Maximal Objects]], $b$ is a minimal object of $B$ under $\leq^{\text{op}}$. By [[Minimal Objects Under Total Orders as Smallest Objects]], $b$ is then the smallest object of $B$ under $\leq^{\text{op}}$, so by [[Duality of Smallest and Greatest Objects]] $b$ is the greatest object of $B$ under $\leq$. $\blacksquare$
