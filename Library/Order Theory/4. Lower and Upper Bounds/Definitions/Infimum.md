**Definition.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $\leq$ be a partial order on $A$. Suppose $B\subseteq A$. The greatest object of the set $$\{a\in A\mid \forall b\in B \ (a\leq b)\}$$of all lower bounds of $B$, if it exists, is called the **infimum** or the **greatest lower bound** of $B$ and is denoted $\inf(B)$.
