**Definition.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $\leq$ be a partial order on $A$. Suppose $B\subseteq A$. The smallest object of the set $$\{a\in A\mid \forall b\in B \ (b\leq a)\}$$of all upper bounds of $B$, if it exists, is called the **supremum** or the **smallest upper bound** of $B$ and is denoted $\sup(B)$.
