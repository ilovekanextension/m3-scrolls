**Theorem.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $\leq$ be a partial order on $A$. Suppose $B\subseteq A$. Suppose $b$ is the greatest object of $B$ under $\leq$. Then, $b$ is also the supremum of $B$ under $\leq$.

**Proof.** By [[Duality of Smallest and Greatest Objects]], $b$ is the smallest object of $B$ under $\leq^\text{op}$, so by [[Smallest Objects as Infima]] $b$ is the infimum of $B$ under $\leq^\text{op}$. Therefore, by [[Duality of Infimum and Supremum]] $b$ is the supremum of $B$ under $\leq$.
