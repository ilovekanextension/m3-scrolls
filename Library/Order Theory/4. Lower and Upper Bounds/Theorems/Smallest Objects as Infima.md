**Theorem.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $\leq$ be a partial order on $A$. Suppose $B\subseteq A$. Suppose $b$ is the smallest object of $B$. Then, $b$ is also the infimum of $B$.

**Proof.** Suppose $x\in B$. Since $b$ is the smallest object of $B$ under $\leq$, we have $b\leq x$. This shows that $b$ is a lower bound of $B$ under $\leq$. Now suppose $c$ is a lower bound of $B$ under $\leq$. Since $b\in B$, we must have $c\leq b$. This shows that $b$ is the infimum of $B$ under $\leq$. $\blacksquare$
