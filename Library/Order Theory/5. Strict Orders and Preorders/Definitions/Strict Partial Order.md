**Definition.** Let $A$ be a set. A relation $<$ on $A$ is called a **strict partial order** if it satisfies the following properties.
- **Irreflexivity.** For all $a\in A$, $\neg(a<a)$.
- **Assymetry.** For all $a,b\in A$, if $a<b$, then $\neg(b<a)$.
- **Transitivity.** For all $a,b,c\in A$, if $a<b$ and $b<c$, then $a<c$.

By [[Strict Partial Orders as Assymetric Orders]], assymetry of $<$ can be deduced from the other properties. Therefore, it is enough to mention only irreflexivity and transitivity.
