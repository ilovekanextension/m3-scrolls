**Definition.** Let $A$ be a set. A strict partial order $<$ on $A$ is called a **strict total order** if it satisfies the following additional property.
- **Trichotomy.** For all $a,b\in A$, $a<b$ or $b<a$ or $a=b$.

By [[Exclusivity of Disjunction Criterion of Trichotomy Property on Strict Partial Orders]], trichotomy can be made stronger as follows:
- **Trichotomy.** For all $a,b\in A$, exactly one of the following holds.
	- $a<b$.
	- $b<a$.
	- $a=b$.
