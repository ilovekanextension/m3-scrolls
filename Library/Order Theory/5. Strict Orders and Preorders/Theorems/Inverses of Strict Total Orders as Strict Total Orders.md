**Theorem.** Let $A$ be a set. Let $<$ be a strict total order on $A$. Let $>$ be the inverse of $<$. Then, $>$ is also a strict total order on $A$.

**Proof.** Since $<$ is a strict total order, it is a strict partial order, so by [[Inverses of Strict Partial Orders as Strict Partial Orders]] $>$ is also a strict partial order. We will show that $>$ satisfies trichotomy.

Suppose $a,b\in A$. Since $<$ is a strict total order, $a<b$ or $b<a$ or $a=b$. Therefore, $b>a$ or $a>b$ or $a=b$. $\blacksquare$
