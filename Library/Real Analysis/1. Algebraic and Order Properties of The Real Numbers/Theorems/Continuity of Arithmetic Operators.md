**Theorem**. Suppose $X = (x_{n})$ and $Y = (y_n)$ are sequences of real numbers that converges to $x$ and $y$ respectively. Suppose also $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $Z = (z_{n})$ is a sequence of nonzero real numbers that converges to $z \ne 0$. Then
1. $\lim X + Y = x + y$
2. $\lim XY = xy$
3. $\lim X / Z = x/z$
4. $\lim cX = cx$

**Proof**.
