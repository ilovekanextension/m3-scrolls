**Definition.** The category $\mathsf{Ring}$ of rings
- has the following data:
	1. **Objects.** Objects in $\mathsf{Ring}$ are rings.
	2. **Morphisms.** Morphisms in $\mathsf{Ring}$ are ring homomorphisms.
- admits the following structures:
	1. **Identities.** Any ring $R$ in $\mathsf{Ring}$ has an identity ring homomorphism $\text{id}_{R}:R\to R$.
	2. **Composition.** Ring homomorphisms $\phi:R\to S$ and $\eta:S\to T$ can be composed into $\eta\circ\phi:R\to T$.
