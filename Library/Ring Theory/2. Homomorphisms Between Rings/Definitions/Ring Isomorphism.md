**Definition.** Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. A ring homomorphism $\phi:R\to S$ is said to be a **ring isomorphism** if any (and therefore, by [[Ring Isomorphisms as Bijective Ring Homomorphisms]], all) of the following properties are satisfied.
1. There is a ring homomorphism $\eta:S\to R$ such that $\eta\circ\phi=\text{id}_{R}$ and $\phi\circ\eta=\text{id}_{S}$.
2. $\phi$ is bijective.

A ring isomorphism is therefore an isomorphism in $\mathsf{Ring}$.
If $\phi:R\to S$ is a ring isomorphism, we say that $R$ is **isomorphic** to $S$ and write $$R\cong S.$$
