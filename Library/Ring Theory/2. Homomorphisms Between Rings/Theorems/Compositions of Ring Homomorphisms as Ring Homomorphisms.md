**Theorem.** Let $R,S,$ and $T$ be rings. Let $\phi:R\to S$ and $\eta:S\to T$ be ring homomorphisms. Then, $\eta\circ\phi$ is also a ring homomorphism.

**Proof.** By [[Compositions of Group Homomorphisms as Group Homomorphisms]], $\eta\circ\phi$ is a group homomorphism from $(R,+)$ to $(T,+)$. By [[Compositions of Monoid Homomorphisms as Monoid Homomorphisms]], $\eta\circ\phi$ is a monoid homomorphism from $(R,\cdot)$ to $(T,\cdot)$. $\blacksquare$
