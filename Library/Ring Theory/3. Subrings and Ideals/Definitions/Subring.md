**Definition.** Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $S$ of $R$ is said to be a **subring** of $R$ if $S$ is a subgroup of $(R,+)$ and a submonoid of $(R,\cdot)$.

If $S$ is a subring of $R$, then $S$ together with $0_{R}$, $1_{R}$, the restricted operations $+$ and $\cdot$, and the restricted function $-(-)$ can be regarded as a ring (hence the name).
