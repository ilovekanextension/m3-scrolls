**Theorem.** Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. Let $\phi:R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Then, $\text{im}(\phi)$ is a subring of $S$.

**Proof.** By [[Images of Group Homomorphisms as Subgroups]], $\text{im}(\phi)$ is a subgroup of $(S,+)$. By [[Images of Monoid Homomorphisms as Submonoids]], $\text{im}(\phi)$ is a subring of $(S,\cdot)$. $\blacksquare$
