**Theorem.** Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. Let $\phi:R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Suppose $T$ is a subring of $R$. Then, $\phi[T]$ is a subring of $S$.

**Proof.** By [[Images of Subgroups Under Group Homomorphisms as Subgroups]], $\phi[T]$ is a subgroup of $(S,+)$. By [[Images of Submonoids Under Monoid Homomorphisms as Submonoids]], $\phi[T]$ is a submonoid of $(S,\cdot)$. $\blacksquare$
