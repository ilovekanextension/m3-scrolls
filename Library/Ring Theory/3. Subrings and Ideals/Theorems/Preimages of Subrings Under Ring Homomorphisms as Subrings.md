**Theorem.** Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. Let $\phi:R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Suppose $T$ is a subring of $S$. Then, $\phi^{-1}[T]$ is a subring of $R$.

**Proof.** By [[Preimages of Subgroups Under Group Homomorphisms as Subgroups]], $\phi^{-1}[T]$ is a subgroup of $(R,+)$. By [[Preimages of Submonoids Under Monoid Homomorphisms as Submonoids]], $\phi^{-1}$ is a submonoid of $(R,\cdot)$. $\blacksquare$
