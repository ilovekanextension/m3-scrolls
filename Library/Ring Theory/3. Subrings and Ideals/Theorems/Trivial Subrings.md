**Theorem.** Let $R$ be a ring.
1. $\{0\}$ is a subring of $R$.
2. $R$ is a subring of $R$.

**Proof of First Statement.** By [[Trivial Subgroups]], $\{0\}$ is a subgroup of $(R,+)$. We will show that $\{0\}$ is a submonoid of $(R,\cdot)$.
- **Closure Under Identity.** By definition, $0\in\{0\}$.
- **Closure Under Composition.** We have $0+0=0$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of Second Statement.** This is clear. $\blacksquare$
