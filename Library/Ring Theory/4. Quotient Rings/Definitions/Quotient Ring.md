**Definition.** Let $R$ be a ring. Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. By [[Ring Structure on Set of Left Cosets of Ideals]], the quotient group $R/I$ together with
- the set $1+I$ and
- the operation $\cdot:R/I\times R/I\to R/I$ defined as $$(a+I)\cdot(b+I)=(a\cdot b)+I$$

forms a ring. We call this ring as the **quotient ring** of $R$ by $I$.
