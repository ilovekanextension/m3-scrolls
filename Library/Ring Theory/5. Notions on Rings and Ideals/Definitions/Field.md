**Definition.** A nontrivial commutative ring $\mathbb{F}$ is called a **field** if for all nonzero objects $a\in \mathbb{F}$ there is $b\in \mathbb{F}$ such that $$a\cdot b=b\cdot a=1.$$
Suppose $a\in \mathbb{F}$. By [[Uniqueness of Multiplicative Inverses]], the object $b$ satisfying the property above is unique. We call it as the **multiplicative inverse** of $a$ and denote it as $a^{-1}$.
