**Definition.** Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Suppose $a\in R$. By [[Principal Ideals as Ideals]], the set $$\{r\cdot a\in R\mid r\in R\}$$is an ideal of $R$. We call this ideal as the **principal ideal** generated by $a$ and denote it as $(a)$.

An ideal $I$ of $R$ is then said to be **principal** if there is $a\in R$ such that $I=(a)$.
