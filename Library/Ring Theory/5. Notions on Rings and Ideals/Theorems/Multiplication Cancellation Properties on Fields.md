**Theorem.** Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field. Suppose $a,b,c\in \mathbb{F}$, and suppose that $a$ is nonzero.
1. Suppose $a\cdot b=a\cdot c$. Then, $b=c$.
2. Suppose $b\cdot a=c\cdot a$. Then, $b=c$.

**Proof.** Since $\mathbb{F}$ is a field, by [[Fields as Integral Domains]] $\mathbb{F}$ is an integral domain. Therefore, by [[Multiplication Cancellation Properties on Integral Domains]] these statements follow immediately. $\blacksquare$
