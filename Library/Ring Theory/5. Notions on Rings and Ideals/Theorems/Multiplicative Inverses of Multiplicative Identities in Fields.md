**Theorem.** Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field.
1. $1$ is nonzero, so $1$ has a multiplicative inverse.
2. We have $$1^{-1}=1.$$

**Proof of First Statement.** Since $\mathbb{F}$ is a field, by definition $\mathbb{F}$ is nontrivial, so $1\neq 0$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of Second Statement.** We have $$1^{-1}\cdot 1=1=1\cdot 1,$$so by [[Multiplication Cancellation Properties on Fields]] $1^{-1}=1$. $\blacksquare$
