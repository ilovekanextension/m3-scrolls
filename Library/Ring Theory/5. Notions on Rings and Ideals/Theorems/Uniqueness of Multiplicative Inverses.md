Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Suppose $a\in R$ is nonzero. A **multiplicative inverse** of $a$ is an object $b\in R$ such that $$a\cdot b=b\cdot a=1.$$
**Theorem.** Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Suppose $a\in R$ is nonzero. Suppose $b$ and $c$ are multiplicative inverses of $a$. Then, $b=c$.

**Proof.** We have
$$\begin{align}
b & =b\cdot 1 \\
 & =b\cdot(a\cdot c) \\
 & =(b\cdot a)\cdot c \\
 & =1\cdot c \\
 & =c.\blacksquare
\end{align}$$
