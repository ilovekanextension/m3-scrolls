**Definition.** Let $R$ be a ring. Suppose $u\in R$. We say that $u$ is a **unit** if there is $a\in R$ such that $$u\cdot a=a\cdot u=1.$$
By [[Uniqueness of Multiplicative Inverses]], the object $a$ above is unique. We call it as the **multiplicative inverse** of $u$ and denote it as $u^{-1}$.

The set of all units of $R$ is denoted as $R^*$.
