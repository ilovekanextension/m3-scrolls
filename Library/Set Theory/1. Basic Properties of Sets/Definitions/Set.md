**Definition.** A **set** is a small collection of objects. If $A$ is a set, the notation $$x\in A$$means that $x$ is a member of $A$. The notation $x\notin A$ means that $x$ is *not* a member of $A$.

Two sets are the same if their members are the same. That is, for all sets $A$ and $B$, we have $A=B$ if for all objects $x$, $$x\in A\iff x\in B.$$
