**Theorem.** The power set of $\varnothing$ is $\{\varnothing\}$. That is, given a set $x$, $$x\in\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)\iff x=\varnothing.$$
**Proof of Forward Implication.** Suppose $x\in\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)$. Then, $x\subseteq\varnothing$. By [[Empty Set as Subset of Any Set]], we have $\varnothing\subseteq x$, so $x=\varnothing$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of Backward Implication.** Suppose $x=\varnothing$. Then, by [[Special Members of Power Sets]], we have $x\in\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)$. $\blacksquare$
