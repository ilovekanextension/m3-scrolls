**Theorem.** Let $A$ be a set.
1. $A\in\mathcal{P}(A)$.
2. $\varnothing\in\mathcal{P}(A)$.

**Proof of First Statement.** By [[Subset Relation as Partial Order]], we have $A\subseteq A$, so $A\in\mathcal{P}(A)$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of Second Statement.** By [[Empty Set as Subset of Any Set]], we have $\varnothing\subseteq A$, so $\varnothing\in\mathcal{P}(A)$. $\blacksquare$
