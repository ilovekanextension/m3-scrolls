**Definition.** Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A relation $f\subseteq A\times B$ is called a **function** if it satisfies the following properties.
- **Totality.** For all $a\in A$, there is $b\in B$ such that $(a,b)\in f$.
- **Functionality.** For all $a\in A$ and $b,c\in B$, if $(a,b)\in f$ and $(a,c)\in f$, then $b=c$.

If $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$, we may write $$f:A\to B.$$Furthermore, if $(a,b)\in f$, we say that $b$ is the **value** of $f$ at $a$ and write $$f(a)=b.$$
