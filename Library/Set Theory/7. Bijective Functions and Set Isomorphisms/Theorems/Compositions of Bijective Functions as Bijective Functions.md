**Theorem.** Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets. Let $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$ be bijective. Then, $g\circ f$ is also bijective.

**Proof.** Since $f$ and $g$ are bijective, by [[Relation Inverses of Bijective Functions as Functions]] $f^{-1}$ and $g^{-1}$ are both functions, so by [[Compositions of Functions as Functions]] $f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$ is also a function. By [[Inverses of Composite Relations]], $$(g\circ f)^{-1}=f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}.$$Therefore, $(g\circ f)^{-1}$ is a function, so by [[Relation Inverses of Bijective Functions as Functions]] $g\circ f$ is bijective. $\blacksquare$
