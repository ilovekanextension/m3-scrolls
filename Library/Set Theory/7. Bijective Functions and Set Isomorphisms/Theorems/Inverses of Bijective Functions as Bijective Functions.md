**Theorem.** Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Let $f:A\to B$ be bijective. Then, $f^{-1}$ is also bijective.

**Proof.** By [[Involution Property on Relation Inverses]], $$(f^{-1})^{-1}=f.$$Therefore, $(f^{-1})^{-1}$ is a function, so by [[Relation Inverses of Bijective Functions as Functions]] $f^{-1}$ is bijective. $\blacksquare$
