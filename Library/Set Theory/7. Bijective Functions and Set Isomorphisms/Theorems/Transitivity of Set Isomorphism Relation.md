**Theorem.** Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets. Suppose that $A\cong B$ and $B\cong C$. Then, $A\cong C$.

**Proof.** Since $A\cong B$, there is a bijective function $f:A\to B$. Since $B\cong C$, there is also a bijective function $g:B\to C$. By [[Compositions of Bijective Functions as Bijective Functions]], $g\circ f:A\to C$ is bijective, so $A\cong C$. $\blacksquare$
