**Definition.** Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Let $f:A\to B$. Suppose $T\subseteq B$. The **preimage** of $T$ under $f$ is the set $$f^{-1}[T]=\{x\in A\mid f(x)\in T\}.$$Therefore, $x\in f^{-1}[T]$ if and only if $f(x)\in T$.

By [[Images Under Inverse Functions as Preimages]], the notation above is unambiguous; if $f$ is bijective, treating the notation as "the preimage of $T$ under $f$" and "the image of $T$ under $f^{-1}$" gives the same results.
