*Definition.* The *comparison* relation on the natural numbers is the relation $$\mathrel{\leq}{}=\{(a,b)\in \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}\mid \exists k\in \mathbb{N} \ (b=a+k)\}.$$By the given set builder notation, $a\leq b$ if and only if there is a natural number $k$ such that $b=a+k$.

If $a\leq b$, we say that $a$ is *less than or equal to* $b$.
