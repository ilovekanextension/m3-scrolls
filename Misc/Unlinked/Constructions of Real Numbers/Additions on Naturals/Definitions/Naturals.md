*Definition.* The mathematical structure of *natural numbers* (hereafter called simply as *naturals*) consists of a set $\mathbb{N}$, an object $0\in \mathbb{N}$ called *zero*, and a function $\sigma:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ called the *successor* function, that satisfies the following properties.
1. $\sigma$ is injective.
2. There is no object $a\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\sigma(a)=0$.
3. *Induction.* For all subsets $A$ of $\mathbb{N}$, if $0\in \mathbb{N}$ and $A$ is closed under $\sigma$, then $A=\mathbb{N}$.
